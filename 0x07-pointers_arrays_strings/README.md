**Even more pointers, arrays and strings**
C - Pointer to Pointer: A pointer to a pointer is a form of multiple indirection, or a chain of pointers. Normally, a pointer contains the address of a variable. When we define a pointer to a pointer, the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer, which points to the location that contains the actual value as shown below.
Multi-dimensional Arrays in C : In C/C++, we can define multidimensional arrays in simple words as an array of arrays. Data in multidimensional arrays are stored in tabular form (in row-major order).The total number of elements that can be stored in a multidimensional array can be calculated by multiplying the size of all the dimensions.
