**Debugging**
In Computer and software development, debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs.

Rubber Duck Debugging: 
Follow the steps:

Explain your (broken) code and its goals, generally. Don’t worry about details, just set the context for your duck.
Line-by-line, explain what the flow of the whole function or method that’s not working is. Don’t skip details, ducks love details!
If your duck friend hasn’t spotted it yet, be sure to explain all the intermediate states and transitions in detail.
Find your (stupid, obvious) solution! The reason we so love “rubber duck debugging” is that (typically) in the process of doing this, you’ll find your problem. You made a small typo. You were operating on the wrong variable. Your if condition was checking the opposite of what you thought. Something is likely to be revealed.
